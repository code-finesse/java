# Java Intro

- What is Java?
- Basic Literals
- Overview of a Basic Program
- Types and Variables
- Sizes and Ranges
    - good to know for interviews, but maybe not for regular use
    - Numbers
        - Java provides several types for integers and fractional numbers that are are often used in arithmetic expressions
        - the sizes of types are always the same no matter the operating system or hardware
        - he most commonly used integer types are `int` and `long`
            - try to use `int` if it is enough for your purposes, otherwise use `long`

        ```java
        int one = 1;
        long million = 1_000_000L;
        ```

        - f**loating-point types** represent numbers with fractional parts
            - Java has two such types: `double` (64 bits) and `float` (32 bits)
            - these types can store only a limited number of significant decimal digits (~6-7 for `float` and ~14-16 for `double`)
            - usually, you will use the `double` type in practice

        ```
        double pi = 3.1415;
        float e = 2.71828f;

        ```

        - when we declare and initialize a `float` variable, we should mark the assigned value with the special letter **f**
        - it is often a good practice to mark a `long` value with **L** as well
    - Characters
        - Java has a type named `char` to represent letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols
        - each character is just a single letter enclosed in single quotes
        - this type has the same size as the `short` type (2 bytes = 16 bits).

        ```java
        char lowerCaseLetter = 'a';
        char upperCaseLetter = 'Q';
        char dollar = '$';
        ```

    - Booleans
        - Java provides boolean types: true and false

        A good mnemonic for remembering all the primitive types in order is: Be Careful! Bears Shouldn't Ingest Large Furry Dogs 
        (Boolean, Char, Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double).
        This also helps to remember their sizes in bits, as it goes - 8, 16, 32, 64 for Byte, Short, Int and Long.
